Helmut the reconciliation server
================================

Helmut is a simplified implementation of the Google Refine/Freebase 
reconciliation API inspired by OpenCorporates.com. Its purpose is 
to generate unique URIs for a provided set of entities and to 
provide fuzzy matching capabilities on these entities to help 
guessing them.
